Work in progress.
Preliminary design!

To do:
Implement a separate N channel Jfet for each dual N channel Jfets "tail".

Implement decoupling capacitor from each source to ground, or a single capacitor from source to source.
Value 10 nF.

Simulate in LTspice.

Sort out and place footprints. 

Make PCB fabrication files.

Write proper readme.
