A small PCB that uses two NE5534 op amps to amplify a signal from a contact microphone.
It has balanced output and should run on +48 phantom power.
Shielded cable must be used for connection to the piezo crystal.
Please use metal film resistors with 1% tolerance or better and audio quality capacitors.
